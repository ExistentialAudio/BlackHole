## FAQ

### Why isn't BlackHole showing up in the Applications folder?
BlackHole is an audio interface driver. It only shows up in `Audio MIDI Setup`, `Sound Preferences`, or other audio applications.

### How can I listen to the audio and use BlackHole at the same time?
[Setup a Multi-Output Device](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device)

### How can I change the volume of a Multi-Output device?
Unfortunately macOS does not support changing the volume of a Multi-Output device but you can set the volume of individual devices in Audio MIDI Setup. 

### How can I use BlackHole with Audacity in Catalina?
Audacity only works with macOS Catalina as of Audacity version 2.4.1 in May 2020. If you have an older version, you will need to upgrade to the latest release.

### Why is nothing playing through BlackHole? 
- Check `System Preferences` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Microphone` to make sure your digital audio workstation (DAW) has microphone access. 

- Check that the volume is all the way up on BlackHole input and output in ``Audio Midi Setup``.

- If you are using a multi-output device, due to issues with macOS the Build-in Output must be enabled and listed as the top device in the Multi-Output. https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole/wiki/Multi-Output-Device#4-select-output-devices

### Where is `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/`?

Chances are you are looking in `~/Library/` or `user/Library/` instead of `/Library`.  

### Can I integrate BlackHole into my app?
BlackHole is licensed under GPL-3.0. You can use BlackHole as long as your app is also licensed as GPL-3.0. For all other applications contact me directly at devinroth@existential.audio.
